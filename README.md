A measure of central tendency (also referred to as measures of centre or central location) is a summary measure that attempts to 
describe a whole set of data with a single value that represents the middle or centre of its distribution.

There are three main measures of central tendency: the mode, the median and the mean. Each of these measures describes a 
different indication of the typical or central value in the distribution.
